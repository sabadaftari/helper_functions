my fav corbit-AI comments:

- The warnings.filterwarnings call is used to suppress a specific deprecation warning. While this may be necessary, it's important to address the underlying issue causing the warning, as ignoring it could lead to future compatibility problems.
- The file does not end with a newline. According to PEP 8, Python's official style guide, your file should end with one newline character. Not having a newline at the end of the file can cause issues with some tools that read the file.
- The commented-out code and the large block of removed code could indicate that there was a refactoring. It's important to ensure that the removed functionality is either no longer needed or has been implemented elsewhere.
- The change in the raw directory path from an absolute path to a relative path './simmunome/data/' is good for portability, but make sure that this does not break any existing functionality where the absolute path might be expected.
- The forward method in the StochasticTwoLayerGCN class applies ReLU activation function after each convolutional layer. However, applying ReLU after the last layer in a model can lead to loss of information, especially if the output is expected to have negative values. Consider removing the ReLU activation after the last layer.
