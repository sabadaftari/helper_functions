my fav corbit-AI comments:

- The warnings.filterwarnings call is used to suppress a specific deprecation warning. While this may be necessary, it's important to address the underlying issue causing the warning, as ignoring it could lead to future compatibility problems.
- The file does not end with a newline. According to PEP 8, Python's official style guide, your file should end with one newline character. Not having a newline at the end of the file can cause issues with some tools that read the file.
- The commented-out code and the large block of removed code could indicate that there was a refactoring. It's important to ensure that the removed functionality is either no longer needed or has been implemented elsewhere.
- The change in the raw directory path from an absolute path to a relative path './simmunome/data/' is good for portability, but make sure that this does not break any existing functionality where the absolute path might be expected.
- The forward method in the StochasticTwoLayerGCN class applies ReLU activation function after each convolutional layer. However, applying ReLU after the last layer in a model can lead to loss of information, especially if the output is expected to have negative values. Consider removing the ReLU activation after the last layer.
- The addition of 'annoy_predict' and 'generate_embeds' to the 'all' list is a good practice if these functions are intended to be part of the public interface of the module. However, it's important to ensure that these functions are properly documented so that other developers can understand their purpose and how to use them.
- The function 'train' is directly printing exceptions to the console using the 'print' function. While this might be useful for debugging, it's not a good practice for production code. Instead, consider using Python's logging module which provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. It's also a good practice to add more context to the error messages. except ValueError as e:
            print(f"{e} for eid={eid}; prob_pos:={prob_pos}")
- The function is missing docstrings. Docstrings are important for understanding the purpose of the function, its inputs, outputs, and any exceptions it may raise.
